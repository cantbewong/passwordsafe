This directory contains the previous "solution" and "project" files
used to build PasswordSafe on Windows with older versions of Microsoft
Visual Studio. The files are not actively maintained, mainly meaning
that if a new source file was added to the project, we did not update
the non-current project files. Also, we did not check that we're using
compiler features that are supported in all of the versions of MSVS.

Files under MSVS8 correspond to Visual Studio 2005.
Files under MSVS10 correspond to Visual Studio 2010.

Files with "_wx" in their name name are used for the WxWidgets build
on Windows (not formally supported).

Currently the best way to work with these is to manually copy them to
their respective directories. If you work on these, please let us
know, and we'll try to automate the process.
